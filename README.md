# How to Run The Code

1. Set environment.
I use Conda because it's easier to have a specific version of Python
Simfire requires Python 3.9, so you can install it using
```conda create -n <env_name> --python=3.9```
(Command might be incorrect, please recheck)
Then activate env
3. Install Simfire
```pip install simfire```
4. cd into directory
5. Run
```python tests/vns.py```

The coverage algorithm is mainly in `tests/vns.py`
